    <h1>A GMM Darts Problem</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Varaun Ramgoolie</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> A Late Tuesday in May</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>
        There exists a game where two players throw darts randomly at a dartboard. After two darts are thrown, 
        a point on the dart board is selected at random, and then the respective distances from the point 
        and the players' darts are measured. These distances are then added to the corresponding player's score. 
        The player with the lowest score wins.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Say at the final round of the game, player \( B \) has \( x \) more points than player \( A \) 
        (they are losing) and player \( A \) is throwing their dart last. What can player \( A \) do to 
        ensure that they don't lose the game?
    </p>
    
    <h2>Attempt at Solution</h2>
    
    <h3>Abstracting the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        We can translate this problem into randomly selecting two points in the Cartesian plane 
        (the darts), selecting another random point on the plane (the reference point for the game), 
        and measuring their distances. We will adopt this notion moving forward.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        At first, the problem seems relatively trivial. I'm actually just doing this to refresh myself 
        with LaTeX before resuming work on some Applied Mathematics solutions (go check that out lol!). 
        The problem is probably trivial, but thanks for making it so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        The actual motivation comes about from this observation. If two right angles share an entire edge, 
        two vertices (including the vertex where the right angle lies), and (at least part) of a base, 
        the difference of the hypotenuses of these right triangles is less than or equal to the difference 
        of the shared component of the base (that is a lot of words, everything will make sense soon).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Obscure Triangle Proof</h3>
    <p>
        We will employ the science that is high-school geometry for this. Let us define Triangle 1 to have 
        vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), and Triangle 2 will have vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C' \). 
        Convince yourself that we can express these points on the Cartesian plane as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
            A &= (0,y), \\
            B &= (0,0), \\
            C &= (x,0), \\
            C' &= ((x+k),0),
        \end{aligned}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        for positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( k \) (practically, the mathematics holds even if these 
        are not strictly positive, due to the effects of translation, symmetry, exchanging of variables, 
        and most importantly, hand-waving).
    </p>
    <p>We want to show that:</p>
    <p>\[
        AC' - AC \leq k.
    \]</p>
    <p>
        First, let us notice that that, by the power of the mighty Pythagorean Theorem:
    </p>
    <p>\[
        \begin{aligned}
            AC' &= \sqrt{(x+k)^2 + y^2}, \\
            AC &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\
            AC' - AC &= \sqrt{(x+k)^2 + y^2} - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
        \end{aligned}
    \]</p>
    <p>
        ... (The remaining proof is formatted similarly, truncated for brevity)
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Congrats for making it so far. I left out a few things in this ‘proof’ because I was kinda lazy just typing. 
        You can perhaps break this problem up into 3 cases, show that 2 of those cases are very obvious, 
        and then throw this mess at the last case to finish your proof. My proofs prof would definitely have 
        some nightmares about how messy this was, but I’m pretty sure it works. Throw some numbers at it 
        and get back to me (or not, your choice).

        Thanks for reading if you did, and take care!
